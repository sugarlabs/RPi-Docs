# Prerequisites for Sugar on Raspberry Pi

Before installing Sugar on Raspberry Pi, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

## For Virtual Machine Setup:

1. **Virtualization Software**: Depending on your operating system, you'll need virtualization software such as VirtualBox, VMware, or QEMU installed.

2. **Host Operating System**: Make sure your host operating system is compatible with the virtualization software you're using.

3. **Sufficient System Resources**: Ensure your host machine has enough CPU, memory, and disk space to run the virtual machine smoothly.

4. **Raspberry Pi OS Image**: Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS Lite image from the official Raspberry Pi website. This image will be used to set up Sugar on Raspberry Pi within the virtual machine.

5. **Optional: SSH Client**: Having an SSH client installed on your host machine can be useful for accessing the virtual machine remotely.

## For Hardware Setup:

1. **Raspberry Pi Hardware**: You'll need a Raspberry Pi board. Any model should work, but for optimal performance, we recommend using a Raspberry Pi 3 or newer.

2. **MicroSD Card/Pendrive**: Prepare a microSD card with a minimum capacity of 8GB. This will be used to install the operating system and Sugar.

3. **Power Supply**: Make sure you have a compatible power supply for your Raspberry Pi board.

4. **Internet Connection**: An internet connection is required to download the necessary software and updates during the installation process.

5. **Raspberry Pi OS Image**: Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS Lite image from the official Raspberry Pi website. Sugar can be installed on top of this OS.

6. **Etcher or Similar Tool**: You'll need a tool like Etcher to flash the Raspberry Pi OS image onto the microSD card.

7. **Keyboard, Mouse, and Display**: Prepare a keyboard, mouse, and display to connect to your Raspberry Pi for initial setup and configuration.

8. **Optional: Access to Terminal or SSH**: For advanced users, having access to the terminal or SSH to your Raspberry Pi can be helpful for configuration and troubleshooting.

Once you have all these prerequisites ready, you're all set to install Sugar on your Raspberry Pi, whether on a virtual machine or physical hardware!
